# Photochemical and RadiatiOn Transport model for Extensive USe (PROTEUS) v1.0

Written by Y. Nakamura in 2024.

PROTEUS is a one-dimensional photochemical model designed to simulate the atmospheric composition and its temporal evolution in various types of planetary atmospheres. PROTEUS is designed for the adaptability to many planetary atmsopheres and the flexibility in adding and modifying chemical reactions by coupling a graphycal user interface (GUI) written in Python and Fortran subroutines.
