# Photochemical and RadiatiOn Transport model for Extensive USe (PROTEUS) v2.0.1

Written by Yuki Nakamura, 17 September 2025

- **PROTEUS v2** is a cross-platform software that utilizes a one-dimensional photochemical model to simulate the composition and temporal evolution of various planetary atmospheres.

- By coupling a **graphical user interface (GUI)** developed with the Electron framework and **Fortran subroutines**, PROTEUS offers both high adaptability to different planetary atmospheres and the flexibility to easily add or modify chemical reactions.

- **If you want to use PROTEUS in your research, please cite the following publication.**
